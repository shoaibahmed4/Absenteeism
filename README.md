# Absenteeism

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on analyzing and predicting absenteeism in the workplace using machine learning techniques i.e., Logistic Regression.

## Files

1. **Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb**
   - Handles data preprocessing, including cleaning, feature selection, and preparation for modeling.
   - Exports a fitted scaler for consistent data transformation during model deployment.

2. **Absenteeism - Logistic Regression.ipynb**
   - Builds and evaluates a logistic regression model to predict absenteeism based on the preprocessed data.
   - Exports the trained logistic regression model for use in production or further analysis.

## Key Features

- Data preparation pipeline for absenteeism datasets.
- Logistic regression implementation with performance evaluation.
- Exportable trained model and scaler for streamlined deployment.
- Insights into workplace absenteeism patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/shoaibahmed4/Absenteeism.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Absenteeism
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the notebooks in the following order:
   - Open and execute **Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb** to preprocess the data and save the scaler.
   - Then, execute **Absenteeism - Logistic Regression.ipynb** to train and evaluate the logistic regression model.
