# Absenteeism
This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focused on analyzing and predicting absenteeism in the workplace using machine learning techniques i.e. Logistic Regression

# Files:
1 - Absenteeism - Preprocessing.ipynb
This notebook handles data preprocessing, including cleaning, feature selection, and preparation for modeling.
Exports a fitted scaler for consistent data transformation during model deployment.

2 - Absenteeism - Logistic Regression.ipynb
This notebook builds and evaluates a logistic regression model to predict absenteeism based on the preprocessed data.
Exports the trained logistic regression model for use in production or further analysis.

# Key Features:
Data preparation pipeline for absenteeism datasets.
Logistic regression implementation with performance evaluation.
Exportable trained model and scaler for streamlined deployment.
Insights into workplace absenteeism patterns.

# Requirements:
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

# How to Use:
Clone the repository, set up the environment, and run the notebooks in order.
